Scenario 1: Algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that was entered

Ask user to enter positive number
If not zero value, repeat algorithm 
If user enter a 0 value
Output largest numbers entered

Request user to enter "positive number” (0 to stop)
Get number

If number is not not equal to 0
	Request user to enter “positive number"
	store largest_number entered for later output

If number is equal to 0
	Display largest number entered is: largest_number
	  

Scenario 2: Algorithm that requests a user to input their name and then stores their name in a variable called first_name. Subsequently the algorithm should print out first_name along with the phrase “Hello world”.

1. Ask user to input name
2. Stores name in variable called first_name
3. Print first_name with “Hello world”

Request user to input their name
Store input as first_name
Print first_name + “Hello World”

Scenario 3: An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average.

1. Read arbitrary number of integers
2. Return arithmetic average

Set sum to 0  
Set count to 0  

Repeat  
    Request user to enter an integer or "done" to stop  
    Get input  

    If input is "done"  
        Exit loop  

    Add input to sum  
    Increase count by 1  

Until input is "done"  

If count > 0 then  
    Print sum / count  
Else  
    Print "No numbers entered”

Scenario 4: An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products (in alphabetical order) that are still left to buy

1. Read grocery list
2. Print products left to buy
3. Input them in alphabetical order

Read grocery_list from user
Read bought_items from user

Set remaining_items = grocery_list deduct bought_items
Sort remaining_items alphabetically

Print remaining_items

Scenario 5: Flowchart

Start

Read X, Y

S = X + Y
A = S / 2 
P = X x Y

Write S, A, P

Stop
